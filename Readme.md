# Generalized Additive Model for traffic prediction


This repo contain 3 Jupyter Notebooks for trajectory prediction of pedestrains, based on velocity & direction. The results outperform many deep learning model, sometimes without any roadmap information.


Furthermore, the transparency of a Glass Box Model allow the exploration of the intricate relationship among all the variables!

The datasets files should be downloaded and extracted in the same directory as the notebooks. Namely, they are:

- Stanford Drone Dataset
- Intersection Drone Dataset
- Argoverse 2 for Motion Forcasting
